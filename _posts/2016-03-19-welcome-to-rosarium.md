Welcome to ~Rosarium~

The personal blog of Justin Bowen.

"The artist vocation is to send light into the human heart." ~George Sand

I may not be an artist. I may not be unusually successful. I may not have many accolades or an untarnished reputation. But if I am able to be and share light, I am able to partake in that work all the world is striving for.
